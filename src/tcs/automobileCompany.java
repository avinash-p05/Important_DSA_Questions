//Problem Statement â€“ An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the given data below:
//
//        1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler)=v
//2nd data, Total number of wheels = W
//The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.
//        Example :
//
//Input :
//        200  -> Value of V
//540   -> Value of W
//
//Output :
//TW =130 FW=70
//
//Explanation:
//        130+70 = 200 vehicles
//        (70*4)+(130*2)= 540 wheels
